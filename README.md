**TR-ES_JG** contains the scripts of our project **BoxPile.** BoxPile is a task manager designed for students with built in tools for planning and academic results tracing. The creation and distribution of this application is part of our investigation in the field of informatics for our final project at high school but we thought it would be interesting to publish it here and make it open source.
